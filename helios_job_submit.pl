=head1 NAME

helios_job_submit.pl - Submit a job to the Helios job processing system from the cmd line

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 helios_job_submit.pl [--verbose] [--no-validate] I<jobclass> [I<jobargs>]

 helios_job_submit.pl MyService "<job><params><myarg1>myvalue1</myarg1></params></job>"

 helios_job_submit.pl --help

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use helios_job_submit.pl to submit a job to the Helios job processing system 
from the command line or a shell script.  In the simplest form, 2 options are 
required.  The first parameter is the jobtype (usually the name of your 
service), and the second is the XML string representing the job's arguments.  
If the second parameter is not given, helios_job_submit.pl will read the job
argument string from STDIN.  If the job submission is successful, the command 
will exit with an exitstatus of 0.  If unsuccessful, the command will exit 
with a non-zero status and will print the error to STDERR.

In addition to the normal command options, there are 2 optional parameters 
that can be specified.  These must be specified I<before> the jobtype and 
argument string:

=item --verbose

If --verbose is specified, the jobid of the new job is returned via STDOUT.  
Without --verbose, the jobid is not returned; this is a backward compatibility 
measure because Helios pre-2.80 did not return a jobid.

=item --no-validate

By default, Helios job argument strings are specified with an XML-like syntax.  
The helios_job_submit.pl command attempts to insure your job argument string 
is well-formed XML by default, but this can slow down the job submission 
process.  Specifying the --no-validate option will turn off the validation step 
and will speed up the submission process.  Keep in mind your job argument 
XML will not be validated before submission.

=head2 validateParamsXML($xml)

Given a wodge of parameter XML (wrapped by <job><params></params></job> tags), 
validateParamsXML returns a true value if the XML is valid, and a false value 
if it isn't.
