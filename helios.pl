=head1 NAME

helios.pl - Launch a daemon to service jobs in the Helios job processing system

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 export HELIOS_INI=/path/to/helios.ini
 [export HELIOS_DEBUG=1]
 helios.pl <jobclass> [--clear-halt]

 # just prints version info
 helios.pl --version

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The helios.pl program, given a subclass of Helios::Service, will launch a daemon to service Helios 
jobs of that subclass.  The number of worker processes to run concurrently and various other 
parameters are set via a helios.ini file and the Helios database (the connection information 
of which is also defined in helios.ini).

Under normal operation, helios.pl will attempt to load the service class specified on the command 
line and use it to read the contents of the helios.ini file.  If successful, it will attempt to 
connect to the Helios collective database and read the relevant configuration parameters from 
there.  If that is successful, helios.pl will daemonize and start servicing jobs of the specified 
class.

In debug mode (set HELIOS_DEBUG=1), helios.pl will not disconnect from the terminal, and will 
output extra debugging information to the screen and the Helios log.  It will also enable debug mode 
on the service class, which may also support the output of extra debugging information.

If the --clear-halt option is specified, helios.pl will attempt to remove a HALT
parameter specified in the Helios configuration for the specified service on the
current host.  This is helpful if you shutdown your Helios service daemon using 
the Helios::Panoptes Collective Admin view.  Note that it will NOT remove a HALT
specified globally (where host = '*').

=head1 HELIOS.INI

The initial parameters for helios.pl are defined in an INI-style configuration file typically 
named "helios.ini".  The file's location is normally specified by setting the HELIOS_INI 
environment variable before helios.pl is started.  If HELIOS_INI is not set, helios.pl will default 
to the helios.ini in the current directory, if present.

A helios.ini file normally contains a [global] section with the parameters 
necessary to connect to the Helios collective database, and any parameters local
to the host on which the Helios service is currently running.  In addition, 
each service class may have its own section in helios.ini containing 
parameters specfic to that service on that host.

Example helios.ini:

 [global]
 dsn=dbi:mysql:host=10.1.0.21;db=helios_db
 user=helios
 password=password

 [LongRunningJobService]
 master_launch_interval=60
 zero_launch_interval=90

 [SearchIndex::LoadTestService]
 OVERDRIVE=1
 MAX_WORKERS=3

=head2 Helios.ini Parameters for helios.pl

=head3 Configuration options to place in the [global] section:

=over 4

=item dsn

Datasource name for the Helios parameter database.  This will also contain the data structures for 
the underlying TheSchwartz queuing system.

=item user

Database user for the datasource name described above.

=item password

Database password for the datasource name described above.

=item pid_path

The location where helios.pl should write the PID file for this service 
instance.  The default is "/var/run/helios".  The name of the PID file will be 
a variation on the service class's name.

=back

=head3 Configuration options to place in individual service sections:

=over 4

=item master_launch_interval

Set the master_launch_interval to determine how long helios.pl should sleep after launching 
workers before accessing the database to update its configuration parameters and check for waiting 
jobs.  The default is 1 second which works well for normally short-lived jobs (2 secs or less), 
but that may be overkill for longer-lived jobs (jobs that run longer than 2 sec).  Setting the 
master_launch_interval option may help prevent needless database traffic for longer running jobs.

=item zero_launch_interval

Set the zero_launch_interval to determine how long helios.pl should sleep after reaching its 
MAX_WORKERS limit.  The default is 10 sec.  If jobs are running long enough that 
helios.pl is frequently hitting is MAX_WORKERS limit (there are waiting jobs but 
helios.pl can't launch new workers because previously launched jobs are still running), increasing 
the zero_launch_interval will reduce needless database traffic.

=back

=head1 HELIOS CTRL PANEL (helios_params_tb)

In addition to helios.ini, certain helios.pl configuration options can be set via the Ctrl Panel 
in the Helios::Panoptes web interface.  These configuration options are read by helios.pl from the 
HELIOS_PARAMS_TB table in the Helios database.  Though the Ctrl Panel is designed mostly to 
provide a standardized interface for service classes to store and retrieve configuration 
parameters, certain helios.pl control parameters can be set here as well.  

The helios.pl daemon will refresh its configuration parameters from the database after waiting 
master_launch_interval seconds after launching worker processes.  If MAX_WORKERS
workers are still running, the helios.pl daemon will wait zero_launch_interval seconds to refresh
its configuration parameters and try to launch workers again.  If you have long running jobs (jobs 
that last more than a few seconds), resetting these parameters higher may help smooth processing 
and reduce needless database traffic.  See the HELIOS OPERATION section below for more 
information.

=head2 helios.pl Control Parameters in Ctrl Panel

=over 4

=item MAX_WORKERS

The Helios system is designed to run one daemon process for each service class per host.  However, 
each service daemon can run more than 1 worker process simultaneously.  The upper limit for worker 
processes is set using the MAX_WORKERS option.  The helios.pl default is 1 worker per 
server.  You can provide a different default for a particular class by specifying a value in 
helios.ini.  If active management of available workers is not necessary for a 
particular service class, this option can be set in helios.ini.

=item OVERDRIVE

Speed up job processing by allowing workers to service jobs until no more are in the queue.  
Normally, a worker process will service a single job and then exit (1:1 worker/job ratio).  With 
OVERDRIVE mode enabled, a worker process will keep servicing jobs until it can find no more of 
that type in the job queue (1:many worker/job ratio).  This may help to speed up processing for 
short-lived jobs, as once a worker process has started, it will stay in memory, continuing to 
process jobs until there are no more to process.  This can also enable on-the-fly caching of 
resources, as once a worker has loaded a resource or established a database connection for a job 
it can be held for use by subsequent jobs, potentially reducing database load or disk I/O.  Longer 
running jobs may not benefit as much, however.

Like MAX_WORKERS, if active management of the job processing mode is not necessary, this
parameter can be set in helios.ini (though that is discouraged).

=item HOLD

If set to 1, a HOLD parameter will cause the helios.pl service daemon to stop launching new workers 
to process jobs.  Currently processing jobs will be allowed to complete, and those worker 
processes will end normally.    

Setting HOLD to 0 will allow normal job processing to resume.

=item HALT

If a HALT parameter is defined, the helios.pl service daemon will start process cleanup and will 
exit.  As with HOLD = 1, jobs currently processing will complete, and the worker processes 
will exit normally.  

Once a helios.pl daemon has HALTED, there is no way to restart it from the Helios::Pantoptes 
interface.  It must be restarted from the command line with a 'helios.pl <serviceclass>' command.

As of Helios 2.22, service daemons can also be shut down in the normal *nix manner of using 
the 'kill' command to send the daemon a SIGTERM signal.

=item WORKER_MAX_TTL

The time in seconds to allow a worker to run.  If you have a problem with 
workers that get stuck while performing a job (perhaps waiting for a database
connection, or some other problem), you can set WORKER_MAX_TTL for that service.
The helios.pl program will check to see if workers for that service are 
running beyond their intended time-to-live, and kill them if they run too long.

=head1 HELIOS OPERATION

After initial setup, the helios.pl daemon will enter a main operation loop where configuration 
parameters are refreshed, the job queue is checked, and worker processes are launched and 
cleaned up after.  A HOLD = 1 parameter will temporarily cause the loop to pause processing, while
a HALT parameter will cause the helios.pl daemon to exit the loop, clean up, and exit.

There are several steps in the helios.pl main operation loop:

=over 4

=item 1.

Refresh configuration parameters from database.

=item 2.

Check job queue to see if there are jobs available for processing (if not, sleep for 
zero_sleep_interval seconds and start again).

=item 3.

If there are jobs available, check to see how many worker processes are currently running.  
If MAX_WORKERS workers are already running, sleep for zero_launch_interval seconds and 
start again.  The zero_launch_interval setting should be long enough to allow at least some of 
the running jobs to complete (the default is 10 secs).

=item 4.

Subtract the number of currently running workers from MAX_WORKERS and launch that 
many workers to handle the available jobs.  If MAX_WORKERS is 5 and only 2 
workers are running, that means the helios.pl daemon will launch 3 workers.  If 
there are less than MAX_WORKERS jobs available for processing, only 1 worker 
will be launched to reduce job contention between workers in the collective.

=item 5.

Sleep master_launch_interval seconds and start the operation loop again.

The daemonize() function is called to turn the Helios program into a daemon 
servicing jobs of a particular class.  It forks a new process, which disconnects
from the launching terminal.

Normally, daemonization would also include setting up signal handling, but the 
daemonize() function isn't called in debug mode, so signal traps are actually 
set up in the main program.

=cut

sub daemonize {
    # prep system interaction stuff
    # attempt to be a good daemon (unlike in the past) 
    chdir File::Spec->rootdir();
    # don't think I need these w/close()ing them below, 
    # but I'll put them in for perlipc's sake anyway
    open STDIN, '/dev/null';
    open STDOUT, '>/dev/null';
    open STDERR, '>/dev/null';
    
	my $pid = fork;   
	# make sure fork was successful
	unless ( defined($pid) ) {
		die "Cannot daemonize: $!";
	}

	# we forked, but are we parent or child?
	if ($pid) {
		# we got a PID, so we're the parent ("shell-called process")
		# print a nice message about daemonizing and exit
		print "$worker_class daemon launched.\n";
		exit();
	} 

	# we got 0, so we're the "child", or the parent daemon
	# we need to write our PID out to a file 
	# and then disconnect completely from the shell
	write_pid_file($params->{pid_path}) or die($worker->errstr);

	# Detach from the shell entirely by setting our own
	# session and making our own process group
	# as well as closing any standard open filehandles.
	POSIX::setsid();
#[] I may have changed religions on this one
#	close (STDIN); 
#	close (STDOUT); 
#	close (STDERR);

	# set up signal handling in main process 
}


=head2 double_clutch() 

The double_clutch() function implements the WORKER_MAX_TTL functionality.  If 
the WORKER_MAX_TTL parameter is set for a service, the service daemon 
periodically calls double_clutch() to check the workers and clean up any that 
have run too long.  The double_clutch() function waits a certain amount of time 
(zero_launch_interval x2 secs), then checks the amount of time each of the 
running workers has been active.  If a worker has been running longer than the 
service's WORKER_MAX_TTL, the worker is killed (by sending it a SIGKILL signal).

=cut

sub double_clutch {
    # sleep $WORKER_MAX_TTL_WAIT_INTERVAL secs before we double check on workers
	sleep $WORKER_MAX_TTL_WAIT_INTERVAL;
    foreach my $pid (keys %workers) {
        my $time_of_death = $workers{$pid} + $params->{WORKER_MAX_TTL};
        if ( time() > $time_of_death ) {
            kill 9, $pid;
            delete $workers{$pid};
            $worker->logMsg(LOG_ERR, "Killed process $pid (exceeded WORKER_MAX_TTL)");
        }
    }
    return 1;
}


=head2 launch_worker()

The launch_worker() function launches a new worker process.  
After the fork() from the main process, the new child process will call 
launch_worker().  The launch_worker() function will instantiate a new 
TheSchwartz object, set the object's B<ability> (TheSchwartz term) to the class 
of the loaded service, and starts the worker on its way by calling the work() 
method.  If the OVERDRIVE run mode is enabled for the service, the 
work_until_done() method is called instead.

=cut

sub launch_worker {
    # just in case this would cause a problem in worker process
    $SIG{CHLD} = 'DEFAULT';
    $SIG{TERM} = 'DEFAULT';
	my $client = Helios::TheSchwartz->new(databases => $DATABASES_INFO);
	$client->can_do($worker_class);
	my $return;
	if ( defined($params->{OVERDRIVE}) && $params->{OVERDRIVE} == 1 ) {
		$return = $client->work_until_done();			
	} else {
		$return = $client->work_once();
	}
	exit($return);

=head1 SIGNAL HANDLERS

=head2 reaper()

The reaper() function is responsible for cleaning up after dead child processes.  It's called when 
helios.pl receives a SIG_CHLD signal.  The function reaps any children with waitpid(), removes the 
children's PID from the $workers hash of running workers, and re-establishes itself as the signal 
handler for the next SIG_CHLD signal.

=cut

sub reaper {
	my $pid;
	if ($DEBUG_MODE) { print "REAPING!\n"; }
	while (($pid = waitpid(-1, &WNOHANG)) > 0) {
		if ($pid == -1) {
			if ($DEBUG_MODE) { print "REAPED IGNORING\n"; }
			# no child waiting.  Ignore it.
		} elsif (WIFEXITED($?)) {
			delete $workers{$pid};
			if ($DEBUG_MODE) { print "REAPED Process $pid exited.\n"; }
			if ($DEBUG_MODE) { print "REAPED $pid: $?\n"; }
		} else {
			if ($DEBUG_MODE) { print "REAPED False alarm on $pid.\n" }
		}
	}
	if ($DEBUG_MODE) { print "FINISHED REAPING\n"; }
	$SIG{CHLD} = \&reaper;
	if ($DEBUG_MODE) { print "EXIT REAPER!\n"; }
}


=head2 terminator()

The terminator() function is responsible for shutting down a Helios service 
instance when helios.pl receives a SIGTERM signal.  The shutdown process 
performs several steps:

=over 4

=item * 

Sets HALT in the Helios config params for the loaded service, so the 
worker processes know to exit at the end of their current job

=item * 

Sleeps a certain amount of time (zero_launch_interval x 2 secs) to 
allow worker processes to complete the jobs they are processing and exit

=item * 

Reaps any ended worker processes, and forcably kills any that are still 
running.  After zero_launch_interval seconds, workers for a particular service 
should have exited if HALT is set.  If you use this method of shutting down 
Helios services and repeatedly see a particular service's workers not exiting 
properly, increase the value of the zero_launch_interval configuration 
parameter for that service in your helios.ini or Helios::Panoptes Ctrl Panel. 

=item * 

Clears the HALT parameter set earlier, since all of the workers are now 
shut down (one way or the other).

=item * 

Removes the service's PID file written in the pid_path set in 
helios.ini

=item * 

Unregister's with the Helios collective's registry table in the Helios
database

=item * 

Issues a final log message indicating the loaded service has shut down 
on the current host

=back

Once all these steps are complete, the helios.pl program exits.


=cut

sub terminator {
    my $TERM = 0;
    # did we receive a SIGTERM, or was the HALT config param set?
    if ( defined($params->{HALT}) ) {
        $worker->logMsg(LOG_NOTICE, "HALTING $CLASS on host ".$worker->getHostname());
    } else {

    exit(1);
}


=head1 PID FILE FUNCTIONS

=head2 write_pid_file($pid_path)

Writes a PID file to a location (defaults to /var/run/helios) to track which daemons are 
running.  The file will be named after the service class running, all lowercase, with colons 
replaced by underscores.  For example, the PID file for a service class named 
'SearchIndex::LoadTestWorker' will be named "searchindex__loadtestworker.pid".  To change the 
location where the PID file is created, set the pid_path option in helios.ini.

=cut

sub write_pid_file {
	my $pid_path = shift;
	my $fh;
	# Determine where to put the PID file
	unless (defined($pid_path) ) {
		$pid_path = $DEFAULTS{PID_PATH};
	}

	# Determine PID filename
	my $filename = lc($worker_class);
	$filename =~ s/\:/\_/g;
	$PID_FILE = File::Spec->catfile($pid_path, $filename.'.pid');
	if ($DEBUG_MODE) { print "Writing pid file $PID_FILE\n";	}
	
	open $fh, ">", $PID_FILE or do { $worker->errstr("Cannot write PID file $PID_FILE: ".$!); return undef; };
	print $fh $$;
	close $fh;

	return 1;
}


=head2 remove_pid_file($pid_file)

During a clean shutdown, remove_pid_file() is called to delete the PID file 
associated with the service daemon.

=cut

sub remove_pid_file {
	my $pid_file = shift;
	unless ( defined($pid_file) ) {
		$pid_file = $PID_FILE;
	}
	unlink $pid_file or do { $worker->errstr("Cannot remove PID file $pid_file: ".$!); return undef; };
	return 1;
}


=head2 running_process_check($pid_path)

Given the pid_path, check to see if a $pid_file for the loaded service class exists and, if it does,
check to see if that process is still running.  If the file doesn't exist or it does but isn't 
running, this function returns 0.  If the process is still running, record the error and return the 
running process's pid to signal that service startup should halt. 

=cut

sub running_process_check {
	my $pid_path = shift;
	# Determine where the PID file should be
	unless (defined($pid_path) ) { $pid_path = $DEFAULTS{PID_PATH}; }

	# Determine PID filename
	my $filename = lc($worker_class);
	$filename =~ s/\:/\_/g;
	$PID_FILE = File::Spec->catfile($pid_path, $filename.'.pid');
	if ($DEBUG_MODE) { print "Checking $PID_FILE\n"; }

	# check if this file exists
	# if it does, check if that process is still running
	# bail if it is
	if (-r $PID_FILE) {
		my $pid = `cat $PID_FILE`;
		my $pinfo = `ps -p $pid|wc -l`;
		# is this process still running?
		if ($pinfo > 1) {
			$worker->errstr($worker->getJobType()." service daemon already running (process ".$pid.").");
			return $pid;
		} 
	}
	return 0;
}


=head1 OTHER FUNCTIONS

=head2 clean_shutdown()

The clean_shutdown function is called when helios.pl is intentionally shutdown 
(setting a HALT parameter in the Helios::Panoptes Ctrl Panel or sending the 
helios.pl process a TERM signal).  It removes the PID file created on 
startup and unregisters the service instance from the collective database.

=cut 

sub clean_shutdown {
	remove_pid_file() or $worker->logMsg(LOG_CRIT, $worker->errstr);
	unregister() or $worker->logMsg(LOG_CRIT, $worker->errstr);
	return 1;
}


=head2 register()

The register() function records information about the currently running worker daemon in the 
database.  The register() function is designed to be run every $REGISTRATION_INTERVAL seconds.  
That way, if a service daemon dies off unexpectedly (without calling unregister()), it can be 
determined that something has happened to the daemon and it possibly needs to be restarted.

(In reality, register() and unregister() are only necessary to provide a display for Panoptes, 
to more easily assess system status and facilitate the HALTing of service daemons or HOLDing of 
job processing.)

=cut

sub register {
	try {
		my $dbh = $worker->dbConnect();
		$dbh->do("DELETE FROM helios_worker_registry_tb WHERE worker_class = ? AND host = ?", undef, 
					$worker->getJobType(), $worker->getHostname) or die;
		$dbh->do("INSERT INTO helios_worker_registry_tb (register_time, start_time, worker_class, worker_version, host, process_id) VALUES (?,?,?,?,?,?)", undef,
					time(), $START_TIME, $worker->getJobType(), $worker->VERSION, $worker->getHostname, $$) or die;
	} otherwise {
		throw Helios::Error::DatabaseError($DBI::errstr);
	};
	return 1;
}


=head2 unregister()

The unregister() function removes any record of the currently running daemon from the database.  
It is called whenever there is a clean shutdown.

=cut

sub unregister {
	try {
		my $dbh = $worker->dbConnect();
		$dbh->do("DELETE FROM helios_worker_registry_tb WHERE worker_class = ? AND host = ?", undef, 
					$worker->getJobType(), $worker->getHostname) or die;
		$dbh->disconnect();
	} otherwise {
		throw Helios::Error::DatabaseError($DBI::errstr);
	};
	return 1;
}


=head2 set_halt()

Set a HALT parameter for the currently loaded service on the current host to 
signal to all of the worker processes that they need to exit.  This function is 
used by the terminator() function to safely signal to workers they need to exit
when the current job is completed.

=cut

sub set_halt {
	try {
		if ($DEBUG_MODE) { 
			print "Attempting to set HALT for ",$worker->getJobType()," on ",$worker->getHostname(),"\n"; 
		}
		my $dbh = $worker->dbConnect();
		$dbh->do("INSERT INTO helios_params_tb (worker_class, host, param, value) VALUES (?,?,?,?)", undef, 
					$worker->getJobType(), $worker->getHostname, 'HALT', '1');
	} otherwise {
		throw Helios::Error::DatabaseError($DBI::errstr);
	};
	return 1;	
}


=head2 clear_halt()

If the --clear-halt option is specified on the command line, clear_halt() is called to attempt to 
clear the HALT parameter in the HELIOS_PARAMS_TB.  For safety reasons, it only clears a HALT for 
the loaded service class AND the specific host helios.pl is running on; it will not clear a global
HALT parameter (where the host is specified as '*').

=cut

sub clear_halt {
	try {
		if ($DEBUG_MODE) { 
			print "Attempting to delete HALT for ",$worker->getJobType()," on ",$worker->getHostname(),"\n"; 
		}
		my $dbh = $worker->dbConnect();
		$dbh->do("DELETE FROM helios_params_tb WHERE worker_class = ? AND host = ? AND param = ?", undef, 
					$worker->getJobType(), $worker->getHostname, 'HALT');
	} otherwise {
		throw Helios::Error::DatabaseError($DBI::errstr);
	};
	return 1;
