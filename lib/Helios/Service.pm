# FILE CHANGE HISTORY:
# [2011-12-07]: Updated to support new Helios::Logger API.  Added 
# %INIT_LOG_CLASSES global.  Completely rewrote logMsg() method.  Updated 
# logMsg() documentation.
# [2011-12-07]: Updated copyright info.
# [2011-12-07]: Removed parseArgXML() method (redundant).
# [2011-12-28]: Removed unnecessary 'use XML::Parser' line.
# [2011-12-28]: Replaced metajob running code in work() with new runMetajob()
# method.
# [2011-12-28]: work(): changed so CACHED_CONFIG and

# [2011-12-28]: Updated copyright info.
# [2012-01-01]: Renamed runMetajob() method to metarun().
# [2012-01-01]: work(): replaced old code calling the service class's run()

# [2012-01-04]: Fixed max_retries() and retry_delay() so they actually pay 
# attention to MaxRetries() and RetryInterval().  In the original code they 
# didn't, and MaxRetries() and RetryInterval() did not work as documented.
# [2012-01-08]: work(): explicitly return 0 to the calling routine.

# [2012-03-27]: added initLoggers() method to handle logger module 
# initialization.
# [2012-04-25]: added deferredJob() method.
# [2012-05-20]: work: removed driver and logger debugging code.  Removed 
# comment about removing a debug message before release (it is useful to leave 
# that debugging message in).
# [2012-05-20]: dbConnect(): removed old commented-out code.
# [LH] [2012-07-11]: Switched use line for Data::ObjectDriver::Driver::DBI to 
# load Helios::ObjectDriver::DBI to start integration of database connection 
# caching.
# [LH] [2012-07-15]: Changed prep() to use new Helios::Config class.  Removed 
# 'use Config::IniFiles' because with Helios::Config it's redundant.
# [LH] [2012-07-15]: replaced most of dbConnect() code to implement fork-safe 
# database connection creation and sharing.
# [LH] [2012-07-15]: replaced most of jobWaiting() code for simplicity and to

=head1 NAME

Helios::Service - base class for services in the Helios job processing system

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Helios::Service is the base class for all services intended to be run by the 
Helios parallel job processing system.  It handles the underlying TheSchwartz job queue system and 
provides additional methods to handle configuration, job argument parsing, logging, and other 
functions.

A Helios::Service subclass must implement only one method:  the run() method.  The run() method 
will be passed a Helios::Job object representing the job to performed.  The run() method should 
mark the job as completed successfully, failed, or permanently failed (by calling completedJob(),
failedJob(), or failedJobPermanent(), respectively) before it ends.  

=head1 TheSchwartz HANDLING METHODS

The following 3 methods are used by the underlying TheSchwartz job queuing 
system to determine what work is to be performed and, if a job fails, how it 
should be retried.

YOU DO NOT NEED TO TOUCH THESE METHODS TO CREATE HELIOS SERVICES.  These 
methods manage interaction between Helios and TheSchwartz.  You only need to 
be concerned with these methods if you are attempting to extend core Helios
functionality.  

=head2 max_retries()

Controls how many times a job will be retried.  

=head2 retry_delay()

Controls how long (in secs) before a failed job will be retried.  

These two methods should return the number of times a job can be retried if it fails and the 
minimum interval between those retries, respectively.  If you don't define them in your subclass, 
they default to zero, and your job(s) will not be retried if they fail.

=head2 work()

The work() method is the method called by the underlying TheSchwartz::Worker (which in turn is 
called by the helios.pl service daemon) to perform the work of a job.  Effectively, work() sets 
up the worker process for the Helios job, and then calls the service subclass's run() method to 
run it.

The work() method is passed a job object from the underlying TheSchwartz job queue system.  The 
service class is instantiated, and the the job is recast into a Helios::Job object.  The service's 
configuration parameters are read from the system and made available as a hashref via the 
getConfig() method.  The job's arguments are parsed from XML into a Perl hashref, and made 
available via the job object's getArgs() method.  Then the service object's run() method is 
called, and is passed the Helios::Job object.

Once the run() method has completed the job and returned, work() determines 
whether the worker process should exit or stay running.  If OVERDRIVE mode is 
enabled and the service hasn't been HALTed or told to HOLD, the worker process 
will stay running, and work() will be called to setup and run another job.  If 
the service is not in OVERDRIVE mode, the worker process will exit.

=head2 metarun($job)

Given a metajob, the metarun() method runs the job, returning 0 if the 
metajob was successful and nonzero otherwise.

This is the default metarun() for Helios.  In the default Helios system, 
metajobs consist of multiple simple jobs.  These jobs are defined in the 
metajob's argument XML at job submission time.  The metarun() method will 
burst the metajob apart into its constituent jobs, which are then run by 
another service.  

Metajobs' primary use in the base Helios system is to speed the job submission 
process of large job batches.  One metajob containing a batch of thousands of 
jobs can be submitted and burst apart by the system much faster than thousands 
of individual jobs can be submitted.  In addition, the faster jobs enter the 
job queue, the faster Helios workers can be launched to handle them.  If you 
have thousands (or tens of thousands, or more) of jobs to run, especially if 
you are running your service in OVERDRIVE mode, you should use metajobs to 
greatly increase system throughput.

=head1 ACCESSOR METHODS

These accessors will be needed by subclasses of Helios::Service.

 get/setConfig()
 get/setHostname()
 get/setIniFile()
 get/setJob()
 get/setJobType()
 errstr()
 debug()

Most of these are handled behind the scenes simply by calling the prep() method.

After calling prep(), calling getConfig() will return a hashref of all the configuration parameters
relevant to this service class on this host.

If debug mode is enabled (the HELIOS_DEBUG env var is set to 1), debug() will return a true value, 
otherwise, it will be false.  Some of the Helios::Service methods will honor this value and log 
extra debugging messages either to the console or the Helios log (helios_log_tb table).  You can 
also use it within your own service classes to enable/disable debugging messages or behaviors.

It does set the job type for the object (available via the getJobType() method).

=head1 INTERNAL SERVICE CLASS METHODS

When writing normal Helios services, the methods listed in this section will 
have already been dealt with before your run() method is called.  If you are 
extending Helios itself or instantiating a Helios service outside of Helios 
(for example, to retrieve a service's config params), you may be interested in 
some of these, primarily the prep() method. 

=head2 prep()

The prep() method is designed to call all the various setup routines needed to 
get the service ready to do useful work.  It:

=over 4

=item * 

Pulls in the contents of the HELIOS_DEBUG and HELIOS_INI env vars, and sets the appropriate 
instance variables if necessary.

=item *

Calls the getConfigFromIni() method to read the appropriate configuration parameters from the 
INI file.

=item *

Calls the getConfigFromDb() method to read the appropriate configuration parameters from the 
Helios database.

=back

Normally it returns a true value if successful, but if one of the getConfigFrom*() methods throws 
an exception, that exception will be raised to your calling routine.

=head2 getConfigFromIni([$inifile]) DEPRECATED

The getConfigFromIni() method opens the helios.ini file, grabs global params and config params relevant to
the current service class, and returns them in a hash to the calling routine.  It also sets the class's 
internal {config} hashref, so the config parameters are available via the getConfig() method.

Typically service classes will call this once near the start of processing to pick up any relevant 
parameters from the helios.ini file.  However, calling the prep() method takes care of this for 
you, and is the preferred method.

=head2 getConfigFromDb() DEPRECATED

The getConfigFromDb() method connects to the Helios database, retrieves config params relevant to the 
current service class, and returns them in a hash to the calling routine.  It also sets the class's 
internal {config} hashref, so the config parameters are available via the getConfig() method.

Typically service classes will call this once near the start of processing to pick up any relevant 
parameters from the helios.ini file.  However, calling the prep() method takes care of this for 
you.

There's an important subtle difference between getConfigFromIni() and getConfigFromDb():  
getConfigFromIni() erases any previously set parameters from the class's internal {config} hash, 
while getConfigFromDb() merely updates it.  This is due to the way helios.pl uses the methods:  
the INI file is only read once, while the database is repeatedly checked for configuration 
updates.  For individual service classes, the best thing to do is just call the prep() method; it 
will take care of things for the most part.

=head2 getFuncidFromDb()

Queries the collective database for the funcid of the service class and 
returns it to the calling routine.  The service name used in the query is the 
value returned from the getJobType() accessor method.  

This method is most commonly used by helios.pl to get the funcid associated 
with a particular service class, so it can scan the job table for waiting jobs.
If their are jobs for the service waiting, helios.pl may launch new worker 
processes to perform these jobs.

Creates a Data::ObjectDriver object connected to the Helios database and 
returns it to the calling routine.  Normally called by getDriver() if an 
D::OD object has not already been initialized.

object for use by other methods.  This will greatly reduce the number of open 
connections to the Helios database.

Determine whether or not to exit if OVERDRIVE mode is enabled.  The config

process should exit().

This method is used by helios.pl and Helios::Service->work().  Normal Helios
services do not need to use this method directly.

=head1 METHODS AVAILABLE TO SERVICE SUBCLASSES

The methods in this section are available for use by Helios services.  They 
allow your service to interact with the Helios environment.

# BEGIN CODE Copyright (C) 2012 by Logical Helion, LLC.

=head2 dbConnect($dsn, $user, $password, $options)

Method to connect to a database in a "safe" way.  If the connection parameters 
are not specified, a connection to the Helios collective database will be 
returned.  If a connection to the given database already exists, dbConnect() 
will return a database handle to the existing connection rather than create a 
new connection.

The dbConnect() method uses the DBI->connect_cached() method to reuse database 
connections and thus reduce open connections to your database (often important
when you potentially have hundreds of active worker processes working in a 
Helios collective).  It "tags" the connections it creates with the current PID 
to prevent reusing a connection that was established by a parent process.  
That, combined with helios.pl clearing connections after the fork() to create 
a worker process, should allow for safe database connection/disconnection in 
a forking environment.

=head2 logMsg([$job,] [$priority_level,] $message)

Given a message to log, an optional priority level, and an optional Helios::Job
object, logMsg() will record the message in the logging systems that have been 
configured.  The internal Helios logging system is the only system enabled by 
default.

In addition to the log message, there are two optional parameters:

=over 4

=item $job

The current Helios::Job object being processed.  If specified, the jobid will 
be logged in the database along with the message.

=item $priority

The priority level of the message as defined by Helios::LogEntry::Levels.  
These are really integers, but if you import Helios::LogEntry::Levels (with the 
:all tag) into your namespace, your logMsg() calls will be much more readable.  
There are 8 log priority levels, corresponding (for historical reasons) to 
the log priorities defined by Sys::Syslog:

    name         priority
    LOG_EMERG    0
    LOG_ALERT    1
    LOG_CRIT     2
    LOG_ERR      3
    LOG_WARNING  4
    LOG_NOTICE   5
    LOG_INFO     6
    LOG_DEBUG    7
   
LOG_DEBUG, LOG_INFO, LOG_NOTICE, LOG_WARNING, and LOG_ERR are the most common 
used by Helios itself; LOG_INFO is the default.

=back

The host, process id, and service class are automatically recorded with your log 
message.  If you supplied either a Helios::Job object or a priority level, these
will also be recorded with your log message.

This method returns a true value if successful and throws a 
Helios::Error::LoggingError if errors occur.   

=head3 LOGGING SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

Several parameters are available to configure Helios logging.  Though these 
options can be set either in helios.ini or in the Ctrl Panel, it is B<strongly>
recommended these options only be set in helios.ini.  Changing logging 
configurations on-the-fly could potentially cause a Helios service (and 
possibly your whole collective) to become unstable!

The following options can be set in either a [global] section or in an 
application section of your helios.ini file.

=head4 loggers

 loggers=HeliosX::Logger::Syslog,HeliosX::Logger::Log4perl

A comma delimited list of interface classes to external logging systems.  Each 
of these classes should implement (or otherwise extend) the Helios::Logger 
class.  Each class will have its own configuration parameters to 
set; consult the documentation for the interface class you're trying to 
configure.

=head4 internal_logger 

 internal_logger=on|off 

Whether to enable the internal Helios logging system as well as the loggers 
specified with the 'loggers=' line above.  The default is on.  If set to off, 
the only logging your service will do will be to the external logging systems.

=head4 log_priority_threshold

 log_priority_threshold=1|2|3|4|5|6   

You can specify a logging threshold to better control the 
logging of your service on-the-fly.  Unlike the above parameters, 
log_priority_threshold can be safely specified in your Helios Ctrl Panel.  
Specifying a 'log_priority_threshold' config parameter in your helios.ini or 
Ctrl Panel will cause log messages of a lower priority (higher numeric value) 
to be discarded.  For example, a line in your helios.ini like:

 log_priority_threshold=6

will cause any log messages of priority 7 (LOG_DEBUG) to be discarded.

This configuration option is supported by the internal Helios logger 
(Helios::Logger::Internal).  Other Helios::Logger systems may or may not 
support it; check the documentation of the logging module you plan to use.

If anything goes wrong with calling the configured loggers' logMsg() methods,
this method will attempt to catch the error and log it to the 
Helios::Logger::Internal internal logger.  It will then rethrow the error 
as a Helios::Error::LoggingError exception.

The initLoggers() method is called to initialize all of the configured

before a service's run() method is called.

This method sets up the Helios::Logger subclass's configuration by calling 
setConfig(), setHostname(), setJobType(), and setDriver().  It then calls the
logger's init() method to finish the initialization phase of the logging class.

error.

These are the basic methods that define your Helios service.  The run() method

in your own Helios service class. 

=cut

sub run {
    throw Helios::Error::FatalNoRetry($_[0]->getJobType.': run() method not implemented!'); 
}

=head2 MaxRetries() and RetryInterval()

These methods control how many times a job should be retried if it fails and 
how long the system should wait before a retry is attempted.  If you don't 
defined these, jobs will not be retried if they fail.   

=cut

sub MaxRetries { return undef; }
sub RetryInterval { return undef; }

=head2 JobClass()

Defines which job class to instantiate the job as.  The default is Helios::Job, 
which should be fine for most purposes.  If necessary, however, you can create 
a subclass of Helios::Job and set your JobClass() method to return that 
subclass's name.  The service's work() method will instantiate the job as an 
instance of the class you specified rather than the base Helios::Job.

NOTE:  Please remember that "jobs" in Helios are most often only used to convey 
arguments to services, and usually only contain enough logic to properly parse 
those arguments and mark jobs as completed.  It should be rare to need to 
extend the Helios::Job object.  OTOH, if you are attempting to extend Helios 
itself to provide new abilities and not just writing a normal Helios

=head2 ConfigClass()

Defines which configuration class to use to parse your service's 
configuration.  The default is Helios::Config, which should work fine for most 
applications.  If necessary, you can create a subclass of Helios::Config and 
set your ConfigClass() method to return that subclass's name.  The service's 
prep() method will initialize your custom config class and use it to parse your 
service's configuration information.

See the L<Helios::Config> documentation for more information about creating 
custom config classes.
