=head1 NAME

Helios::Error::FatalNoRetry - fatal exception class for Helios indicating a 
job failed and the error was so serious the job should not be reattempted.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# in dodgy code:

	use Error qw(:try);

	sub dodgy {

		if ($something_bad) {
			throw Helios::Error::Fatal("Ah! Thats not gone well at all!");
		}
	}


	# in the caller of the dodgy code:

	use Error qw(:try);

	try {
		dodgy(@params);
	} catch Helios::Error::FatalNoRetry with {
		my $e = shift;
		$self->logMsg( $e->text() );
		$self->failedJob( $job, $e->text() );
	};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Helios::Error::FatalNoRetry can be used to identify errors that cause a job not only to fail but 
to not be re-attempted by the job processing system.  This implies an error that should be logged 
and the Schwartz job in question should be marked as permanently failed (with the 
Helios::Worker->failedJobPermanent() method).

Compare this to Helios::Error::Fatal, which implies a similar circumstance except the 
error isn't severe enough to prevent the system from re-attempting later.
