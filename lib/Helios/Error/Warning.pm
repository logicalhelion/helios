=head1 NAME

Helios::Error::Warning -  exception class for Helios indicating a job was
successful but it encountered errors during processing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# in dodgy code:

	use Error qw(:try);

	sub dodgy {

		... dodgy stuff ...


		if ($success_but_a_bit_off) {
			throw Helios::Error::Warning("This job succeeded with errors");
		}
	}


	# in the caller of the dodgy code:

	use Error qw(:try);

	try {
		dodgy(@params);
	} catch Helios::Error::Warning with {
		my $e = shift;
		$self->logMsg( $e->text() );
		$self->jobCompleted($job);
	};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Helios::Error::Warning can be used to identify errors that were not severe enough to cause a job 
to fail, but probably should be logged.  Normally this would mean simply logging the error, and 
calling the $job->completed() method as normal.

Compare this to Helios::Error::Fatal and FatalNoRetry, which imply errors that caused the job to 
fail completely.
