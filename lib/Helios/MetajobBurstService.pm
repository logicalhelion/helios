=head1 NAME

Helios::MetajobBurstService - base class for metajob burst services in Helios

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Helios::MetajobBurstService is a subclass of Helios::Service specially tasked with bursting 
metajobs.  You can subclass this class to provide special metajob bursters for your application.  
This allows you more fine grained control over the volume of jobs entering the Helios job queue.

A MetajobBurstService class supports one config parameter, burst_interval, which is the 
number of seconds between metajob bursts.  This is to prevent the metajob bursting process from 
running so fast the Helios job queue is overwhelmed with burst jobs.
