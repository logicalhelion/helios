Helios version 2.41
===================

Helios is a system for building asynchronous distributed job processing 
applications.  Applications that need to process millions of small units of 
work in parallel can use the Helios system to scale this work across the 
multiple processes and servers that form a Helios collective.  Helios may also 
be used to improve the user experience on websites.  By utilizing the 
framework's APIs, potential timeout issues can be eliminated and response times 
decreased for larger tasks invoked in response to user input.  The web server 
application can "fire and forget" in the background, immediately returning 
control to the user.  Using Helios, simple Perl applications can be written 
to distribute massive workloads throughout the Helios collective while 
still retaining centralized management.
